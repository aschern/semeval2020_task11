this	O

that	O
the	O

I	O
hope	O
that	O
you	O

my	O
poor	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
better	O
to	O
speak	O
some	O
bad	O

because	O
to	O
translate	O

take	O

As	O
Mr.	O
Matt	O
said	O
,	O
the	O
crisis	O
in	O
the	O
Church	O
is	O
very	O
extraordinary	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
understand	O
the	O
situation	O
today	O

My	O
seminary	O

Econe	O

Why	O
?	O

These	O

are	O
the	O

as	O
seminaries	O
were	O
before	O
the	O
Second	O

They	O

All	O
is	O
done	O
as	O
all	O
the	O

Why	O
are	O
we	O
now	O
in	O
this	O
very	O
sad	O
situation	O
with	O
Rome	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
because	O
in	O
the	O
Second	O
Vatican	O

,	O
and	O
after	O
the	O

But	O

say	O

as	O

I	O
am	O
out	O

by	O

Mgr	O

That	O

That	O

very	O

we	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

it	O

We	O
are	O

we	O

to	O
offer	O
the	O
true	O

as	O
I	O
have	O
visited	O
my	O

here	O
in	O
Armada	O
for	O
the	O
past	O
five	O
days	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
is	O
the	O

here	O

We	O
have	O
very	O
good	O
young	O

I	O
also	O
have	O
some	O
Americans	O
in	O
my	O

In	O
six	O

I	O
will	O
ordain	O
one	O
American	O

is	O
a	O
very	O

They	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
ask	O
you	O
to	O
pray	O
for	O
these	O

because	O
when	O
they	O

they	O

have	O
many	O

And	O
we	O

I	O

it	O

the	O

we	O
become	O
most	O

Indeed	O

in	O

that	O
the	O

comes	O

that	O

many	O

we	O

penniless	O

We	O
’re	O
unemployable	O

”	O
And	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
tempted	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
“	O
Well	B-PROP

,	O
this	O
is	O
for	O
the	O

”	O
the	O
reality	O
is	O
that	O
these	O
are	O
not	O
small	O
considerations	O
.	O

Many	O
priests	O
are	O
getting	O
older	O
–	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
with	O
health	O
issues	O
–	O
and	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
has	O
already	O
given	O
20	O
or	O
30	O
years	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
to	O
the	O
Church	O
is	O
faced	O
with	O
a	O
practical	O
impossibility	O
if	O
he	O
finds	O
himself	O
blacklisted	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
who	O
do	O
n’t	O
fit	O
this	O
mould	O
;	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
second	O
careers	O
in	O
the	O
priesthood	O
and	O
plenty	O
of	O
people	O
go	O
into	O
seminary	O
after	O
some	O
years	O
in	O
the	O
normal	O
workforce	O
and	O
can	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
it	O
at	O
need	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
now	O
coming	O
forward	O
with	O
complaints	O
against	O
McCarrick	O
,	O
who	O
left	O
the	O
priesthood	O
over	O
their	O
experiences	O
,	O
have	O
gone	O
on	O
to	O
have	O
normal	O
,	O
healthy	O
working	O
lives	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
think	O
honestly	O
most	O
priests	O
are	O
in	O
this	O
corner	O
and	O
they	O
know	O
it	O
and	O
so	O
do	O
their	O
bishops	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
goes	O
forward	O
in	O
great	O
faith	O
,	O
spends	O
ten	O
to	O
fifteen	O
years	O
studying	O
philosophy	O
and	O
theology	O
-	O
fields	O
that	O
have	O
almost	O
no	O
application	O
in	O
the	O
workforce	O
outside	O
academia	O
or	O
the	O
Church	O
-	O
with	O
the	O
honest	O
,	O
and	O
frankly	O
fair	O
,	O
expectation	O
of	O
a	O
lifetime	O
of	O
employment	O
and	O
a	O
safety	O
net	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
.	O

As	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
said	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
“	O
The	O
old	O
arrangement	O
was	O
,	O
‘	O
Remain	O
faithful	O

do	O
the	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
will	O
look	O
after	O

We	O
’ll	O
house	O
,	O
feed	O
and	O
clothe	O
you	O
and	O
look	O
after	O
your	O
retirement	O
.	O
’	O
The	O
new	O
arrangement	O
is	O
a	O
perversion	O
of	O
that	O
:	O
‘	O
Keep	O
quiet	O

go	O
along	O

’	O
”	O

So	O
what	O
do	O
we	O
do	O
?	O

The	O
Old	O
Paradigm	O
is	O
destroyed	O
and	O
going	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
New	O
Paradigm	O
is	O
a	O
guarantee	O
of	O
destruction	O
for	O
yourself	O
and	O
everyone	O

As	O
we	O
saw	O
in	O
Ireland	O
this	O
week	O
,	O
the	O
Purge	O
has	O
started	O
.	O

It	O
’s	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
simply	O
demand	O
that	O
a	O
priest	O
continue	O
in	O
his	O
ministry	O
no	O
matter	O
what	O
.	O

We	O
need	O
to	O
start	O
working	O
together	O
with	O
faithful	O

–	O
while	O
there	O
still	O
are	O
some	O

to	O

If	O
we	O
who	O
still	O
love	O
the	O
Church	O
want	O
priests	O
to	O
be	O
faithful	O

and	O
even	O
to	O
start	O
denouncing	O
the	O
evil	O

they	O

we	O
are	O

a	O
modicum	O

for	O

to	O

themselves	O
not	O
only	O

There	O
’s	O
one	O
big	O

No	O

facing	O
penury	O

permanent	O

We	O
should	O
never	O

any	O

go	O
into	O
any	O
diocesan	O
seminary	O
without	O

just	O
make	O
two	O
points	O

Number	O
one	O
is	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
President	O
Obama	O
versus	O
President	O
Trump	O
,	O
there	O
’s	O
no	O
question	O
that	O
President	O

more	O

with	O

collaborative	O
with	O
Russia	O

the	O

President	O
Trump	O
has	O

—	O
a	O
crucial	O
issue	O
for	O
Putin	O

which	O
President	O

refused	O
to	O
do	O

President	O
Trump	O
has	O

the	O
Assad	O
forces	O
in	O
Syria	O
,	O
a	O
client	O
state	O
of	O
Putin	O
,	O
something	O
that	O
Obama	O
refused	O
to	O
do	O
because	O
he	O
did	O
n’t	O
want	O
to	O
provoke	O
Putin	O
.	O

Trump	O
has	O
expelled	O
more	B-PROP

[	O

this	O

that	O

is	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
puppet	B-PROP
of	O
Putin	O

that	O

-	O
I	O
proposed	O
that	O
an	O
exemplary	O
measure	O
be	O
taken	O
against	O
the	O
Cardinal	O
that	O
could	O
have	O
a	O
medicinal	O
function	O

to	O
prevent	O
future	O

against	O

and	O
alleviate	O
the	O
very	O
serious	O
scandal	O
for	O
the	O
faithful	O

who	O
despite	O
everything	O
continued	O
to	O
love	O
and	O
believe	O
in	O
the	O
Church	O
.	O

I	O
added	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
salutary	O
if	O
,	O
for	O
once	O
,	O
ecclesiastical	O
authority	O
would	O
intervene	O
before	O
the	O
civil	O
authorities	O

if	O
possible	O

before	O
the	O

had	O
broken	O
out	O
in	O
the	O

This	O
could	O
have	O
restored	O
some	O
dignity	O
to	O
a	O

so	O
sorely	O
tried	O
and	O
humiliated	O
by	O
so	O
many	O
abominable	O
acts	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
some	O
pastors	O

If	O
this	O
were	O
done	O
,	O
the	O
civil	O
authority	O
would	O
no	O
longer	O
have	O
to	O
judge	O
a	O
cardinal	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
pastor	O
with	O
whom	O
the	O
Church	O
had	O
already	O
taken	O
appropriate	O
measures	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O

:	O
“	O

that	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O

as	O
possible	O
by	O
removing	O
the	O
cardinal	O
’s	O
hat	O
from	O
Cardinal	O
McCarrick	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
subjected	O
to	O
the	O
sanctions	O
established	O
by	O
the	O
Code	O

Canon	O

I	O
was	O
greatly	B-PROP

for	O
the	O
inconceivable	O
absence	O
of	O
any	O

to	O
those	O
now	O
imposed	O
on	O
him	O
by	O
Pope	O
Francis	O
:	O
the	O
Cardinal	O
was	O
to	O

he	O
was	O
forbidden	O

I	O
do	O
not	O

when	O

took	O
these	O
measures	O
against	O
McCarrick	O
,	O
whether	O
in	O
2009	O

because	O

just	O

who	O

this	O
incredible	B-PROP

I	O
certainly	O
do	O
not	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
Pope	O
Benedict	O
,	O
who	O
as	O
Cardinal	O
had	O
repeatedly	O
denounced	O
the	O
corruption	O
present	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
first	O

I	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
Pope	O

first	O
collaborator	O
at	O
the	O

Cardinal	O

who	O
notoriously	O
favored	O

The	O
faithful	O

how	O
it	O

for	O
him	O
to	O

appointed	O

Regarding	O
Cardinal	O
Sean	O
O’Malley	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
simply	O
say	O
that	O
his	O
latest	O
statements	O
on	O
the	O
McCarrick	O
case	O
are	O
disconcerting	B-PROP

and	O
have	O

My	O

requires	O
me	O
also	O
to	O
reveal	O
facts	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
experienced	O
personally	O

concerning	O
Pope	O

have	O

responsibility	O
of	O
all	O
the	O

do	O
not	O

me	O

that	O

them	O
under	O

In	O
the	O
last	O
months	O
of	O
his	O
pontificate	O
,	O
Pope	O
Benedict	O
XVI	O
had	O
convened	O
a	O
meeting	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
apostolic	O
nuncios	O
in	O
Rome	O
,	O
as	O
Paul	O
VI	O
and	O
St.	O
John	O
Paul	O
II	O
had	O
done	O
on	O
several	O
occasions	O
.	O

The	O
date	O
set	O
for	O
the	O
audience	O
with	O
the	O
Pope	O
was	O
Friday	O
,	O
June	O
21	O
,	O
2013	O
.	O

Pope	O
Francis	O
kept	O
this	O
commitment	O
made	O
by	O
his	O
predecessor	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
I	O
also	O
came	O
to	O
Rome	O
from	O
Washington	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
my	O
first	O
meeting	O
with	O
the	O
new	O
Pope	O
elected	O
only	O
three	O
months	O
prior	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
resignation	O
of	O
Pope	O
Benedict	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
Thursday	O
,	O
June	O
20	O
,	O
2013	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
Domus	O
Sanctae	O
Marthae	O
,	O
to	O
join	O
my	O
colleagues	O
who	O
were	O
staying	O
there	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
entered	O
the	O
hall	O
I	O
met	O
Cardinal	O
McCarrick	O
,	O
who	O
wore	O
the	O
red	O
-	O
trimmed	O
cassock	O
.	O

I	O
greeted	O
him	O
respectfully	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
always	O
done	O
.	O

He	O
immediately	O
said	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
tone	O
somewhere	O
between	O
ambiguous	O
and	O
triumphant	O
:	O
“	O
The	O
Pope	O
received	O
me	O
yesterday	O
,	O
tomorrow	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
China	O
.	O
”	O

At	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
his	O
long	O
friendship	O
with	O
Cardinal	O
Bergoglio	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
important	O
part	O
he	O
had	O
played	O
in	O
his	O
recent	O
election	O
,	O
as	O
McCarrick	O
himself	O
would	O
later	O
reveal	O
in	O
a	O
lecture	O
at	O
Villanova	O
University	O
and	O
in	O
an	O
interview	O
with	O
the	O
National	O
Catholic	O
Reporter	O
.	O

Nor	O
had	O
I	O
ever	O
thought	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
participated	O
in	O
the	O
preliminary	O
meetings	O
of	O
the	O
recent	O
conclave	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
role	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
have	O
as	O
a	O
cardinal	O
elector	O
in	O
the	O
2005	O
conclave	O
.	O

Therefore	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
immediately	O
grasp	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
the	O
encrypted	O
message	O
that	O
McCarrick	O
had	O
communicated	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
would	O
become	O
clear	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
days	O
immediately	O
following	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
the	O
audience	O
with	O
Pope	O
Francis	O
took	O
place	O
.	O

After	O
his	O
address	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
partly	O
read	O
and	O
partly	O
delivered	O
off	O
the	O
cuff	O
,	O
the	O
Pope	O
wished	O
to	O
greet	O
all	O
the	O
nuncios	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
.	O

In	O
single	O
file	O
,	O
I	O
remember	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
among	O
the	O
last	O
.	O

When	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
turn	O
,	O
I	O
just	O
had	O
time	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
“	O
I	O
am	O
the	O
Nuncio	O
to	O
the	O
United	O
States	O
.	O
”	O
He	O
immediately	O
assailed	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
tone	O
of	O
reproach	O
,	O
using	O
these	O
words	O
:	O
“	O
The	O
Bishops	O
in	O
the	O
United	O
States	O
must	O
not	O
be	O
ideologized	O
!	O

They	O
must	O
be	O
shepherds!”Of	O
course	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
explanations	O
about	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
his	O
words	O
and	O
the	O
aggressive	B-PROP
way	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
upbraided	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O
a	O
book	O
in	O
Portuguese	O
that	O
Cardinal	O
O’Malley	O
had	O
sent	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
Pope	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
earlier	O
,	O
telling	O
me	O
“	O
so	O
he	O
could	O
go	O
over	O
his	O
Portuguese	O
before	O
going	O
to	O
Rio	O
for	O
World	O
Youth	O
Day	O
.	O
”	O
I	O
handed	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
freed	O
myself	O
from	O
that	O
extremely	O
disconcerting	O
and	O
embarrassing	O
situation	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
audience	O
the	O
Pope	O
announced	O
:	O
“	O
Those	O
of	O
you	O
who	O
are	O
still	O
in	O
Rome	O
next	O
Sunday	O
are	O

with	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
Domus	O
Sanctae	O
Marthae	O
.	O
”	O
I	O
naturally	O
thought	O
of	O
staying	O
on	O
to	O
clarify	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
what	O
the	O
Pope	O
intended	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
.	O

On	O
Sunday	O
June	O
23	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
concelebration	O
with	O
the	O
Pope	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
Monsignor	O
Ricca	O
,	O
who	O
as	O
the	O
person	O
in	O
charge	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
helped	O
us	O
put	O
on	O
the	O
vestments	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
ask	O
the	O
Pope	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
receive	O
me	O
sometime	O
in	O
the	O
following	O
week	O
.	O

How	O
could	O
I	O
have	O
returned	O
to	O
Washington	O
without	O
having	O
clarified	O
what	O
the	O
Pope	O
wanted	O
of	O
me	O
?	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
Mass	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
Pope	O
was	O
greeting	O
the	O
few	O
lay	O
people	O
present	O
,	O
Monsignor	O
Fabian	O
Pedacchio	O
,	O
his	O
Argentine	O
secretary	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
said	O
:	O
“	O
The	O
Pope	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
ask	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
free	O
now	O

”	O
Naturally	O
,	O
I	O
replied	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
Pope	O
’s	O
disposal	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
thanked	O
him	O
for	O
receiving	O
me	O
immediately	O

The	O
Pope	O
took	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
floor	O
in	O
his	O
apartment	O
and	O
said	O
:	O
“	O
We	O
have	O
40	O
minutes	O
before	O
the	O
Angelus	O

”	O

I	O
began	O
the	O
conversation	O
,	O
asking	O
the	O
Pope	O
what	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
words	O
he	O
had	O
addressed	O
to	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
greeted	O
him	O
the	O
previous	O
Friday	O

And	O
the	O
Pope	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
different	O
,	O
friendly	O
,	O
almost	O
affectionate	O
tone	O

Immediately	O
after	O
,	O
the	O
Pope	O
asked	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
deceitful	O
way	O
:	O
“	O
What	O
is	O
Cardinal	O

I	O
answered	O
him	O
with	O
complete	O
frankness	O

,	O
if	O

with	O
great	O

The	O

then	O

what	O
was	O
the	O
Pope	O

“	O

the	O

mention	O
“	O

could	O
be	O
traced	O
to	O
