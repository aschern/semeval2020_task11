Groups of Migrants Heading to San Diego Will Be Met With Barricades And Razor Fences (Videos)

The Military continues to put up razor wire at the border in San Ysidro as a migrant caravan is expected to reach Tijuana.
United States military and border protection agents have been erecting barricades with razor wire at the point of entry near San Diego, California, as the first groups of migrants arrived at the US-Mexico border.
Hundreds of migrants who had split off from the main ‚Äòcaravan‚Äô of thousands arrived in Tijuana early Tuesday on nine buses.
Numbering just over 350, they joined an initial smaller group of around 85 people, mostly members of the LGBT community, who‚Äôd experienced discrimination within the main crowd and were helped to make it to the Mexican border town even earlier on Sunday.

RT reports:
In anticipation of potential clashes at the border, American soldiers have begun reinforcing their positions.
‚ÄúDepartment of Defense personnel are installing concertina wire, and pre-positioning jersey barriers, barricades, and fencing,‚Äù US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement.

A snaking line of traffic is visible at the San Ysidro Port of Entry after CBP announced it would close multiple entry lanes into the U.S. at two San Diego-area ports of entry in anticipation of the so-called migrant caravan's arrival.

To tackle any ‚Äúpotential safety and security risk,‚Äù the CBP also announced lane closures at the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa ports of entry, to install ‚Äúport hardening infrastructure equipment‚Äù in preparation for the migrant caravan arrival.
Currently, several thousand predominantly male Central American migrants heading for the US are in the western Mexico city of Guadalajara.
Most of them intend to take the Pacific coast route to reach the US, which is still about 1,500 miles away.

To deal with the perceived threat the US has deployed 5,200 troops to help more than 2,000 National Guardsmen thwart what President Trump describes as an impending migrant‚Äúinvasion.‚Äù
Over the past few weeks, the active-duty servicemen deployed under Operation Faithful Patriot have mainly been erecting barbed-wire fences along the border in Texas, California and Arizona, as well as building shelter accommodation for customs and border protection staff.
To ensure the success of the military operation, in addition to sheer troop numbers, the US forces have drones, helicopters with night-vision capabilities, and fixed-wing aircraft at their disposal.
