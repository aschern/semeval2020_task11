Rat: I hear you went to the Dodgers/Giants game. What was the score? Pig: Giants one. Dodgers two. Rat: How can they both win? Pig: They didn't. I said the Giants had one. Rat: And the Dodgers, too? Pig: Right. Rat: That makes no sense. Did you at least happen to see how many runs the Padres scored in their game? Pig: Four. Rat: For my bet. I have big money on them. Pig: Then I hope that's the number you needed. Rat: What's the number I needed? Pig: I just told you. If you don't believe me, ask my German friend, Hans. Rat: Fine. Do you know how many runs the Padres scored? Hans: Nein. Rat: You said it was four something. Pig: You said it was for something. Rat: Dude, just gimme the right Dodgers/Giants score and I'll buy you your stupid lunch, unless you already had foot at the game. Pig: Ate nothing. Rat: Who had nothing? Pig: Me. Rat: Ahhhhhhhhhh. Pig: I was too upset the Dodgers had won.
