Donald Trump on Wednesday said he does not need $1 billion in fundraising for a general presidential election.

“There’s no reason to raise that,” he said at Trump Tower in New York City, according to Bloomberg Politics.

{mosads}“I just don’t think I need nearly as much money as other people need, because I get so much publicity. I get so many invitations to be on television. I get so many interviews, if I want them.”

Bloomberg Politics on Wednesday reported Trump would not commit to fundraising even half of his previously pledged $1 billion total. He also gave no specific benchmark for how much cash his campaign needs.

Trump has conducted only two fundraising events since agreeing to help the Republican National Committee (RNC) raise funds last month.

Trump’s campaign in late May made an arrangement with the RNC allowing the organization to conduct events with the billionaire and split the proceeds.

Donors can write one check to a joint-fundraising committee, maxing out at $449,000, with the first $2,700 going to Trump’s campaign and the remaining cash split up between state and local parties.

Trump late last month headlined his first joint-fundraiser with the RNC in Albuquerque, N.M., charging guests $10,000 apiece.

Another event in Santa Monica, Calif., meanwhile, reportedly raised $6 million for the RNC and Trump’s coffers.

Trump’s second fundraiser had a minimum admission price of $25,000, while host committee members paid $100,000 each. Donations were maxed out at $449,000.

Trump has repeatedly bragged his personal fortune frees him from fundraising and the influence of wealthy special interests. He agreed to help the RNC raise money for down-ballot Republicans, however, shortly after becoming the party’s de facto presidential nominee in May.
