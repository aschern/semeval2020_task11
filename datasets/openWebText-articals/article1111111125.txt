What will be the size of the Magento development team assigned to my project?

We prepare project proposals that pay special attention to your situation and timelines and compose teams according to your project needs. That means, we assign professionals that have relevant domain and technical backgrounds, so the work is more efficient and requires fewer engineers. We can provide you even with a team of 10+ professionals, but in most cases, you won’t need that much — our Magento e-commerce development services and processes are really efficient.
