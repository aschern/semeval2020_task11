Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Friday took himself out of the running as a potential vice presidential candidate for Donald Trump.

“I’m going to pass on that,” the Republican governor who endorsed Trump following his victory in the state’s March 15 primary told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “Think about it. I’ll have two years left when Donald gets elected president. I want to finally have a federal partner that’s going to focus on jobs. We’ve added almost 1.1 million jobs. If I had somebody in the White House who cared about jobs, just think of what I could accomplish in my last two years.”

Scott, who will meet with Trump on Monday at Trump Tower, said he would tell Trump “no” if asked to submit his information for vetting.
