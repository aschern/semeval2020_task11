Tor.com Publishing is proud to announce that we’ve acquired a trilogy of novellas from Myke Cole, author of the Shadow Ops series. Cole’s new trilogy is an exciting fantasy adventure featuring magic, persecution, and war machines. The first book in the series is titled The Fractured Girl.

Myke Cole had this to say:

“Grimdark fantasy has long been my favorite subgenre. I love the flawed characters and stark, gray storyscape, with the smallest hint of redemption glowing on the horizon. After 6 military fantasy novels, I’ve been itching to try my hand at something totally different, and I’m doubly psyched to be doing it with Tor.com Publishing. I loved The Builders, and Tor.com has always been one of my favorite sites to read and write for. Heloise Factor is my favorite kind of hero, the one who makes mistakes and suffers for them, and comes out swinging anyway. I can’t wait for you to meet her.”
