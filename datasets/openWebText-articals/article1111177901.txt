SAN JOSE, Calif. – The San Jose Sharks returned home in an 0-2 hole against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2016 Stanley Cup Final.

They needed something to rally them. Needed that extra level to elevate their game. Needed that … Beast Mode.

Enter Marshawn Lynch, the recently retired Seattle Seahawks great, whose unstoppable “Beast Mode” runs made him the best running back in the NFL for parts of his nine seasons.

The Oakland native who attended the University of California was the celebrity guest who “opened the door” for the Sharks as they rushed out of their dressing room and through the giant, smoking Sharks head to start the game.

And he rocked a BEAST MODE jersey:

He joins an eclectic list that’s included Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, former U.S. secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Metallica singer James Hetfield.
