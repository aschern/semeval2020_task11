A new online poll released on Saturday shows that Britons who want to leave the European Union have pulled ahead by 10 points of the Remain camp.

The survey of 2,000 people by ORB found that 55 percent believe the U.K. should leave the European Union, up four points since the last poll in April, while 45 percent want it to remain (down four points), according to the Independent.

These figures are reviewed taking into account the people’s likelihood to vote in the June 23 referendum. It is by far the biggest lead the Leave camp has enjoyed since ORB began polling the EU issue for The Independent a year ago, the newspaper said. It was Remain who enjoyed a 10-point lead then. Now the tables have turned.

Even when the findings are not weighted for turnout, Leave is at 53 percent (up three points since April) and Remain at 47 percent (down three). The online poll was taken on Wednesday and Thursday. It suggests the Out camp has achieved momentum at the critical time ahead of the voting day.

Differential turnout could prove crucial. ORB found that 78 percent of Leave supporters say they will definitely vote — describing themselves as a “10” on a 0-10 scale, while only 66 percent of Remain supporters say there’s no doubt they will turn out to cast their ballots.

The poll shows many seem ready to vote for Brexit even if they believe it involves some risk, and think the economy is more important than immigration — widely seen as the Leave camp’s trump card.
