This week was supposed to be the time of year the Cowboys were prepping for the playoffs.

Instead, questions are lingering regarding possible changes on the coaching staff.

But there has been no official news from the Cowboys regarding Jason Garrett's status as head coach. Thursday evening, media reports suggested the Cowboys have made a decision to part ways with Garrett, whose contract is set to expire.

Again, the Cowboys have not announced any news regarding Garrett, who has been the head coach for the last nine full seasons.

Reportedly, Garrett met with Jerry Jones and Stephen Jones on three different occasions, including Thursday.

Garrett led the Cowboys to another 8-8 season this past year, his fourth .500 finish of his career. He went 8-8 his first three full seasons as head coach from 2011-13 before getting to the playoffs in 2014 with a 12-4 record.
