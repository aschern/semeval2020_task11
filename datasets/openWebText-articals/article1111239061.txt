You can file this post away under “Internet weirdness” along with ceramics. The Pottery Village Bed & Breakfast, despite having a minimal official presence online, has been making the rounds on several blogs dedicated to the strange. The photographs (perhaps it’s their quality) remind us of galleries we’ve seen of abandoned theme parks or of roadside attactions along empty highways in the States.

For about $77 a night you can stay in a casita-sized piece of pottery in Yeongheung Island in South Korea. We came across a Korean-language website about the region here. The pots fit in with the overt quaintness of the island: a travel web site states that the area is home to (obviously) beaches, hiking trails, temples and the country’s largest wind power plant.

If you ever find yourself in Yeongheung, please take a few photographs of this intriguing property and let us know what the experience was like.
