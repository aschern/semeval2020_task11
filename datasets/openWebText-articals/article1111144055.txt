Real Madrid battle for Brazilian sensation Reinier Real Madrid Along with Barcelona and Manchester City

Real Madrid are looking to sign Brazilian wonderkid Reinier from Flamengo, but also face competition from other clubs.

After signing Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo in recent seasons, Los Blancos are keen on adding the next major talent to emerge from Brazil to their ranks.

The 17-year-old is being pursued by a number of top European clubs, including Barcelona and Manchester City.

Flamengo value the player at 30 million euros and coach Jorge Jesus recently hinted at his departure, stating that Reinier "will be sold to a big European club for many millions".

In the event that Real Madrid seal the transfer of the Brazilian, he wouldn't join the first team as the three non-EU spots are taken up by Eder Militao, Vinicius and Rodrygo.

Another option could be for Reinier to continue at Flamengo on loan until the summer so that he continue playing first team football.
