Police say a man was stabbed Saturday at a Binghamton residence after an argument involving chicken nuggets.

The 39-year-old victim suffered multiple stab wounds to his abdomen and one just below the ear in the assault, which took place at 8 Crandall St., according to Binghamton Police Capt. Jack Collins. The victim remained hospitalized Wednesday, listed in critical condition, police said.

On Tuesday, investigators arrested Lamont Weaver, 31, of Binghamton, and charged him with a felony count of attempted second-degree murder in connection with the stabbing. He was taken into custody at a Henry Street apartment.

Collins said Weaver and the victim had known each other for a few weeks and investigators believed the stabbing stemmed from an argument over food â€” namely chicken nuggets.

Anyone with information to assist with the ongoing investigation is asked to call Binghamton police detectives at 607-772-7080.
