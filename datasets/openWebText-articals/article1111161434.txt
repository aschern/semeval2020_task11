It may only be a few days old, but the new decade already has its best Star Wars film. According to director JJ Abrams, The Rise of Skywalker is leaps and bounds better than any other mainline entries in the saga released in the 2020s.

“Listen, every Star Wars movie is great in its own way… but only one can truly be defined as being released in the new decade, inspiring a new generation, and successfully rebooting the Roaring Twenties. I’m proud to say that film is The Rise of Skywalker.”

Shockingly, the director celebrated the accolade by canceling his Disney Plus subscription. According to Abrams, the streaming channel is a relic of the 2010s and could potentially set him back by influencing his subconscious into using dated Star Wars tropes in his next films for Warner Bros.

“Baby Yoda is old news. The Rise of Skywalker is the best Star Wars film of the decade, and I’ll go out on a limb by saying my Superman reboot will be the best Superman film of the decade, too. I’m the King of the 2020s!”

Given that Lucasfilm is taking a 3-year break from releasing Star Wars films, at least one of Abrams’ proclamations will hold for a few years. Let’s hope someone can eventually top his effort in this decade.
