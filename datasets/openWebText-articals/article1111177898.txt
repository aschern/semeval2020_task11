Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka, in action for Switzerland today in Euro 2016, has revealed he and his brother give 80% of their pay packets to their parents.

The 23-year-old will no doubt be on significantly more money now after leaving Borussia Monchengladbach for the Gunners last month, but fans will no doubt be impressed by this incredible gesture.

Touted as a real leader and potential future captain, Xhaka’s personality seems a great fit for Arsenal, with personal success clearly not at the forefront of his mind as he gives something back to those who helped him get to where he is now.

‘Because we owe our parents everything, we want to give them something back today,’ Xhaka is quoted in Spox. ‘And we give, each month our income from [football], of course we have a separate account, but 80 percent of our income we send home.

‘We are young, we are naive with money, money can go fast again.

‘If anyone thinks he is something better, just because he has more money in his account… then he can very quickly fall on his face. The family is our greatest luxury.’

The two Xhaka’s will come up against each other this afternoon, with Granit representing Switzerland and Taulant on the opposite side for Albania.
