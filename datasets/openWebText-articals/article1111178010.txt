Should Norwich City striker Kyle Lafferty reproduce his form in Euro 2016 qualification in the actual tournament, more than a few Northern Irishmen will raise a glass to him.

However, in his hometown of Kesh, Co Fermanagh, some will even be able to do so in a pub sharing his name.

For the duration of the tournament, The Mayfly Inn in Kesh will be known as 'Lafferty', after its head of entertainment Robert Anderson suggested the tribute.

'I guess at the minute, with Kyle being from the town, he's on the tip of everyone's tongue,' Mr Anderson told the Irish News. 'With the Euros coming up and him being the main striker, we thought we couldn't let it go without doing so.'

The temporary name change, which has seen banners of the City striker erected, has already caused a stir in the Northern Irish town.

Mr Anderson added: 'It's unreal, it's caused a few traffic jams in town, people are slowing down and taking photographs from their car or observing and there are people taking selfies also.'

Lafferty scored seven times for Northern Ireland in qualifying for the tournament - the same amount as Wayne Rooney and Gareth Bale, and two more than Cristiano Ronaldo.

However, he made just three appearances for the Canaries in all competitions last season, scoring once in League Cup action against West Bromwich Albion.
