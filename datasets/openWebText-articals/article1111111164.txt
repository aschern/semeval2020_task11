I'm joined by comedy veteran Laurie Ayers in this episode to talk about the episode of SNL that starred Lily Tomlin. We talk about how well Lily did, what sketches hold up after all this time and which ones don't and we get a bunch of personal stories from Laurie that connect to this episode. We also talk about how much the show has changed over the years and just how funny was SNL when it was first starting out. I need to add we had tons of technical difficulties in this episode, so thanks again to Laurie for sticking it out and getting this podcast done.
