Remember last year’s surprise from Quantic Dream titled Detroit: Become Human at Paris Games Week? While Sony has made no mention if the game will appear at this year’s E3, it seems someone else did it for the company.

Kinda Funny’s Greg Miller confirmed the game’s involvement at E3 over on Twitter where he said the following:

Conferences Sunday/Monday, but more excited to open Tuesday with Horizon, Batman/Walking Dead, Detroit, more. #E3 pic.twitter.com/r9wmcV0a1a — Greg Miller (@GameOverGreggy) June 8, 2016

While we don’t know if we’ll see pure gameplay or another cinematic trailer, the fact that it’s confirmed that Detroit will be at the event should be comforting enough for some. Additionally, Quantic Dream co-CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière also tweeted to “don’t miss” Sony’s E3 press conference, which heavily implies that Detroit will make an appearance of some sort during Sony’s presentation.

Don’t miss the Playstation Conference, live on 6/13/16! https://t.co/Ywp7OfnqWR — G de Fondaumiere (@GdeFondaumiere) June 7, 2016

PlayStation LifeStyle will, of course, be at the show floor and we’ll try our damnest to get some hands-on time or impressions if we can.

Do you think we’ll see raw Detroit gameplay during Sony’s E3 presser? What are you expecting this time around?
