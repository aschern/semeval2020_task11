Having already penned hits for superstars, Bellion takes a major solo turn. The Human Condition is an alternately beautiful and banging set of pure, modern pop that finds the Long Island singer/songwriter (and author of Eminem and Rihanna’s “Monster”) tackling heady subject matter in relatable terms. He channels the soothing bedside manner of Ben Gibbard on the velvety, hip-hop-informed soft-rock of “80’s Film,” and enlists the same choir that backed MJ on 1987’s “Man in the Mirror” for “Hand of God”—an ethereal, gospel-pop finale that detonates like fireworks in space.
