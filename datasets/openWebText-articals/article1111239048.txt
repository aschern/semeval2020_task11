I stumbled onto this show by accident, online.



The pilot got me interested, the next episode got me exited, and as I just watched the 3rd episode, it had me bawling with laughter.



The final scene, they ask the black guy at the door "are you gay?", having caught him in his underwear with the white openly gay guy.... and his reply is "no, but this n***er sucks really good dick".



Hilarious and refreshingly irreverent!



This show is of a really high quality, well casted and well written, like early seasons of Entourage or Californication... but it's a comedy.



I urge people to see it, so it survives.
