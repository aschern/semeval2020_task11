Very well done podcast. I learned a lot I didn’t know, even though I followed this story closely as it was happening. One thing I wanted to add is that I do not believe Malvo should ever be released from prison. I can give him the benefit of feeling remorse, I can even extend the benefit that he was manipulated to do what he did, but there is a cost for a person’s actions. He can’t remorse his way out of the lives he took. He has to own that for the rest of his life. We are not safe as a society with lee malvo on the streets.
