Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said at a news conference Saturday that Joering and Morelli were shot immediately upon entering.
After the initial hang-up call at noon, a dispatcher called the number back and reached a woman who was crying and could be heard saying, ‘‘won’t let me in.’’
Officers were then sent to the home.
At 12:12 p.m., an officer tells a dispatcher that it’s ‘‘all quiet right now,’’ followed by a door knock.
At 12:13 p.m., after a dispatcher confirmed contact has been made, a man’s voice could be heard yelling, ‘‘We have shots fired.’’
Four minutes later, someone, presumably a police officer, told a dispatcher: ‘‘We have two officers down.
