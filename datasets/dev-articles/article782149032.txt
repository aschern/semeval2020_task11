Horrifying Details Released: 2 Jihadi Muslims At Deadly NM Islamic Compound Hit With New Charges

Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and one of his devout wives were charged with abuse of a child resulting in the death of a child and conspiracy to commit abuse of a child.
Law enforcement rushed to destroy the Islamic compound just days after the kidnapping and murder made national news.
They destroyed evidence, despite the fact that the investigation was new and ongoing.
New charges were filed against the devout (“extremist)” Muslims.
For years, the FBI and local law enforcement did nothing about this jihad compound, despite tips and numerous calls from concerned citizens.
It took the murder of a child to get them to pay attention.
What is the first thing they do after it is discovered a child was murdered on the compound and several starved to almost certain death?
They destroyed the compound to cover up both their negligence and what happened there.
News of what happened there was embarrassing to the Muslim community in the U.S., and making Islam look good seems to be the top priority of law enforcement officials.
It’s sharia compliance in New Mexico.
